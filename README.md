# YTL

YTL or Your template Library is a high-performance, minimal C++20 template library focusing on bare-metal efficiency. 
Built with optimized components originally designed for kernel-level operations.

## Components

### Algorithm

Optimized implementations of common algorithms including search, sort, and heap operations.

### Memory

Highly optimized memory operations with word-size alignment and branchless optimizations.

### String

Fast string manipulation functions optimized for performance with word-aligned operations for maximum efficiency.
Composed of full suite of string operations: length, copy, comparison, search.

### Network

Fast, efficient, HTTPS & UDP

## Desgin Philosophy

- **Minimal**: Only the necessary components are included in the library.
- **Efficient**: All components are optimized for performance.
- **Modern**: Utilizes C++20 features with zero overhead abstractions.

## Requirements

- C++20 capable compiler
- CMake 3.12 or higher
